What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
Merge is used to add/combine all the changes completed in a branch into/with another branch (usually the master branch) by creating a new commit called the merge commit. On the other hand, git rebase will change the base of the branch by adding the commits of the other branch on top, creating a new commit history with a new commit for each of the commits of the other branch.
What is a remote repository?
Contrary to a local repository, a remote repository is a repository hosted somewhere else on a server on the internet, not on your local machine. This allows access to the repository by every member of a team.
